This work addresses the problem of outlier detection in a railway wireless sensor network for energy monitoring purposes. 
Based on the state of the art, an important contribution of a wireless sensor network in the railway system is the availability of useful knowledge of the energy consumption to the decision support systems.

\textit{
Therefore, such acquisition systems are required to provide accurate data regardless of the quality of the acquisition sensors, electromagnetic influences (EMI), sensor supply fluctuations, among others.

\textit{
Through computational algorithms, the increasing of communication reliability and fault tolerance is possible. Those computational algorithms detect outliers or, in the scope of this PhD, detect erroneous data that will perturb the outcomes of decision support systems.
